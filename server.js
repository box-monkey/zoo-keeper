    The first is that the get() method requires two arguments. The first is a string that describes the route the client will have to fetch from. The second is a callback function that will execute every time that route is accessed with a GET request.

    The second takeaway is that we are using the send() method from the res parameter (short for response) to send the string Hello! to our client.
